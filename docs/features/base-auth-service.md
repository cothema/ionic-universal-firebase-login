## Basic authentication service

[Go back to README](../../README.md)

**Class: BaseAuthService**

_Purpose of the class is to simplify working with authentication package features._

You can use this class as a **simple authentication service directly** from this
package or you can **extend the service** and implement it in your way and
override methods which you want to implement differently.

**It is not required to use the service.** If you want, you can omit it.
